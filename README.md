# Advent of Code 2021

These are my solutions to [The Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge series.

## How to run

You can run all of the solutions from day 1 upto the current day by running the following command

```
node index.js
```

Alternatively, you can execute the solution for any particular day by running the .js file in the directory of that particular day, for example

```
node day2/day2.js
```

### Have fun ;)
